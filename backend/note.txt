ONLINE - OFFLINE 

My thinking when the use is on the social media then the my is_online will be 1 from 0;


CASE-1->Suddenly the user closes the tab in the chrome (or any other site) then destroy thr session and the is_online will be agisn back to zero;

CASE-2->Suddenly the user cut off the connection then destroy thr session and the is_online will be agisn back to zero;
